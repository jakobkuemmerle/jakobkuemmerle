## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! The repositories you see here are just a selection of my personal projects that Iâ€™ve made publicly available.

Most of my professional work is confidential and hosted under the GitHub accounts of the companies I collaborate with. If you're interested in learning more about the technologies I've worked with, feel free to reach out!

Let's connect and chat about tech! ðŸš€

Since 2018 I've built managed and scaled cool Data Scientist products around the globe:
